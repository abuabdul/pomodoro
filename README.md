# pomodoro

There are six stages in pomodoro technique:

    1. Decide on the task to be done.
    2. Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally n = 25).
    3. Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, 
       but immediately get back on task.
    4. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
    5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 1.
    6. Else (i.e. after four pomodoros) take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

A pomodoro is the interval of time spent working. After task completion, any time remaining in the pomodoro is devoted to overlearning. Regular breaks are taken, aiding assimilation. A short (3–5 minutes) rest separates consecutive pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. A longer (15–30 minute) rest is taken between sets.

The technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible. When interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity must be recorded and postponed or the pomodoro must be abandoned.
